# FinalProject

Provides examples of Basic JavaScript code including:
- Proper use of variables with proper scope:
  used variables as counters within the typeButton function etc
    
- Good use of conditional logic and value comparison :
  used if statements within typeButton function, and case/switch for the random lengendary bird button
  
- Proper use of String manipulation:
  used within the typeButton function to print message, as well as the cardBack function
  
- Good use of Arrays:
  4 arrays are created within program, 3 based on pokemon type (fireType, waterType, grassType) and one based off rarity of pokemon (rareType)
  
- Use of custom JavaScript objects:
  three objects are made within the program (rareType pokemon) which include mew, mewTwo, and dragonite
------
Demonstrates use of ES6 including:
- Proper use of let and const variablesÂ :
  const was used for the poketype arrays, as well as the querySelector for the main pokemon container
  let was primarily used in the functions which included a forEach (see cardBack, cardFront)
  
- Use of Arrow functions:
  see functions: cardBack, cardFront, printPokemon, typeButton
  
- Use of Strings using Template Literals:
  mostly used in cardBack function as well as typeButton function
  
- Proper declarations of Objects:
  see dragonite, mew, mewTwo
  
- Use of Import and Export statements:
  top of js file for import (pokemon/legendary) 
------
- Using Arrays to store and manipulate collections of data:
 arrays fireType, waterType, grassType were created by filtering the pokemon array to save pokemon based on their type
 
- Use of Objects with key-value pairs:
  rarePokemon objects are automatically assigned the type of rare when they are created
  
- Iteration through an Array using loops and Array methods:
  filter was used to create the pokemon type arrays
  forEach was used in the printPokemon function to sort through the whole array
------
Demonstrates us of Object Oriented Programming techniques including:
- Objects with properties and methods accessed using dot notation:
  primarily used in cardBack function, as well as cardFront and rarePokemon 
  
- Objects using Constructors properly:
  see rarePokemon constructor
  used to create three pokemon which then are saved to an array
